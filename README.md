# Face-emotion-detection
# Purpose

The pupose of this project is to make a emotion detection system based on human face.
As we know there lots of human emetion detection system already exist but the main focus of this project is to increase the accuracy of emotion detection.
We try best to get a accuracy based on our train file that already exists.
