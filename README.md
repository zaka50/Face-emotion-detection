# Face-emotion-detection
# Purpose

The pupose of this project is to make a emotion detection system based on human face.
As we know there lots of human emetion detection system already exist but the main focus of this project is to increase the accuracy of emotion detection.
We try best to get a accuracy based on our train file that already exists.

2.Emotion_saved.h5\
3.dataset[unzip to apply]\
4.classify_train\
5.haarcascade_frontalface_default


# Command to run this program
First of all you wil have to change the directory in emotion_detection01.py code there number
two and five exist and make sure that properly connect in code to this directory\
If you use any platfor like visual studio or pycharm then you will have to install proper extension to run this program

# Howto run locally

python emotion_detection01.py

# Test
I have been tested on my personal pc
